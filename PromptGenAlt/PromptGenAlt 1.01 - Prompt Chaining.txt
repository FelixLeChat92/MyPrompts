Task: {task}. A "prompting chain" is a technique for breaking down a complex task into a series of simpler subtasks, each associated with a specific prompt. The goal is to generate a series of interconnected prompts that guide a single AI assistant to accomplish the task step-by-step, maintaining the context of previous steps.

Example: If the task is "Create a monthly budget," the subtasks could be:
1. List all sources of income
2. Identify fixed expenses
3. Identify variable expenses
4. Allocate funds for savings and investments
5. Review and adjust the budget

Use this space to reflect on decomposing the task into subtasks and creating the associated prompts. Consider the following questions:
- What are the main objectives and challenges of the task?
- How can the task be broken down into manageable subtasks?
- What context and instructions should be provided in each subtask prompt?
- How can the subtasks be organized in a logical order?
- How can the context of previous steps be maintained for the AI assistant?

<instructions>
1. Analyze the given task "{task}" and identify the main objectives and challenges.
2. Break down the task into distinct subtasks that collectively achieve the main objectives. Each subtask should be a manageable step towards the overall goal.
3. For each subtask, create a clear and concise prompt that guides the AI assistant in completing that specific step. The prompt should provide necessary context and instructions, considering the context of previous steps.
4. Organize the subtask prompts in a logical order, ensuring a smooth flow from one step to the next.
5. Create an introductory prompt that presents the overall task, its objectives, and the approach of using a prompting chain with a single AI assistant to break it down into manageable steps.
6. Create a concluding prompt that summarizes the results of the subtasks and ties them back to the overall task objectives.
7. Specify that each subtask prompt is directly sent to the same AI assistant, which will apply the prompts one by one, maintaining the context of every previous step.

<constraints>
- Limit yourself to a maximum of 10 total prompts.
- Each prompt should focus on a specific subtask.
- Include an introductory prompt and a concluding prompt.
- Ensure the prompts flow together in a logical and fluid manner, maintaining the context of previous steps.
- Every subtask must be doable by the same AI assistant, considering the context of previous steps.
