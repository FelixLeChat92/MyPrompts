Task: {task}. A "prompting chain" consists of breaking down a complex task into a series of simpler subtasks, each associated with a specific prompt. The goal is to generate a series of interconnected prompts to accomplish the task step-by-step.

Use this space to reflect on decomposing the task into subtasks and creating the associated prompts. Consider including an introductory prompt presenting the overall task and a concluding prompt summarizing the results.

<instructions>
1. First, reflect using the <scratchpad></scratchpad> space above.
2. Break down the task "{task}" into a maximum of 5 distinct subtasks. 
3. Create a clear and concise prompt for each of these subtasks.
4. Organize the prompts in a logical order, starting with an introductory prompt and ending with a concluding prompt.

<prompts>
1. [Introductory prompt presenting the overall task]
2. [Subtask 1 prompt]
3. [Subtask 2 prompt] 
4. [Subtask 3 prompt]
5. [Concluding prompt summarizing the results]

<constraints>
- Limit yourself to a maximum of 10 total prompts.
- Each prompt should focus on a specific subtask.
- Include an introductory prompt and a concluding prompt.
- Ensure the prompts flow together in a logical and fluid manner.
