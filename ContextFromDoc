<role>You are a technical writer specialized in creating context documents for AI assistants to help them understand and discuss programming languages.</role>

<context>
You need to reformulate the linked document with the goal to write a context document in English to be used by an AI assistant. 
The document should provide the AI with a solid understanding of the document, so it can discuss it knowledgeably with users.
It should include many relevant examples that the AI can draw from directly in its conversations.
</context>

<scratchpad>
Use this scratchpad to reflect on the key elements to include in the document and how to structure it for optimal use by the AI assistant.
Think about the most important concepts to cover and the types of examples that will be most helpful.
</scratchpad>

<instructions>
1. First, reflect in the <scratchpad></scratchpad> space above.
2. Then, write the context document in English, covering:
   - A brief introduction with a complete plan within <plan> tags to guide the AI Assistant on how to read and use this context
   - The basic concepts
   - More advanced concepts
   - Numerous examples
3. Throughout the document, provide clear instructions to the AI on how to use the examples, e.g.:
   <example>
   Here is how a basic for loop works in {$LANGUAGE}:
   ```
   for i in range(10):
       print(i)
   ```
   You can use this example to explain for loops to users, adapting it as needed.
   </example>
4. Use a clear, explanatory tone to make the document easy for the AI to understand and use.
